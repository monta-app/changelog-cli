# Introduction to TechDocs and mkdocs.yaml

TechDocs is a tool used for generating beautiful documentation websites directly from your code repositories. It simplifies the process of creating and maintaining documentation for your projects. One of the key components of TechDocs is `mkdocs.yaml`, a configuration file that allows you to customize various aspects of your documentation site.

## mkdocs.yaml

`mkdocs.yaml` is a YAML configuration file used by MkDocs, the static site generator behind TechDocs. It allows you to define the structure, appearance, and behavior of your documentation website.

In Backstage, the open-source platform for building developer portals, TechDocs is integrated seamlessly, and `mkdocs.yaml` is utilized to configure the documentation site generated by TechDocs.

Inside `mkdocs.yaml`, you can specify various settings such as site title, navigation structure, theme customization, and more. This configuration file plays a crucial role in tailoring your documentation site to meet your project's specific requirements and preferences, providing a seamless experience for your users.
